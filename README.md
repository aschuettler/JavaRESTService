# JavaRESTService
The primary intention to create this project is to help beginners (some hands-on experience in java needed) who want to develop a REST web service application. I am covering almost all the basic requirements for a REST web service. I t can be used as a perfect frame work  which  can be downloaded and used  to make the  REST service application and improve this frame work by adding the business logic in it as per the requirement. This framework is even suitable to use in professional level.
This REST framework is designed with the help of Spring + Jersey + Apache cxf frameworks.  

Details steps are given to develop this frame work step by step  as an  attachment in word format along with this project.

Hope this will help you.
